# Platformer
Platformer is currently a mini-project I am working on. Currently in pre-alpha stages, the game currently has no purpose, but will be made into a platform game.

When the game has most of it's functions, I will pull out a new branch, as the game engine will be done. The game will probably be made into an RPG if I were to decide to spend more time on it.
