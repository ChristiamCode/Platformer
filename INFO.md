# Platformer
Platformer is currently a mini-project I am working on. Currently in pre-alpha stages, the game currently has no purpose, but will be made into a platform game.

When the game has most of it's functions, I will pull out a new branch, as the game engine will be done. The game will probably be made into an RPG if I were to decide to spend more time on it.

# Rules
Anyone is welcome to contribute, however, if you want to make changes to the game and add to the game(currently game engine), you should learn the structure of the code and what I am aiming for in my code. Here is a list of rules that apply to all contributors and upcoming contributors:
<ul>
    <li>The game should have regular platform functions that the player can control. These include jumping, moving and attacking(attacking  should be added in the RPG branch which will be created later on.).</li>
    
    <li>The game should have other things like obstacles in the form of terrain, NPCs, etc.</li>
    
     <li>All code added to the game must be effecient. If the game slows because a piece of code that is not needed or is not a main function, it will be deleted. This will help when the game gets advanced, and I am looking for a smooth running game.</li>
    
     <li>All code added should be appropiate to the branch they are contributing to.</li>
    
     <li>Branches may be made in the pre-alpha stages if they wanted to create their own game engine(currently it isn't a game obviously).</li>
    
     <li>Branches may be made in the future when the RPG branch is created to create their own game/storyline.</li>
    
     <li>Branches may be made when the RPG branch is finished to the RPG branch as mods to change the story line or the game engine/game itself.</li>
